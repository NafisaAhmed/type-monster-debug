            <h1>#1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
            <p class="para-gap">Ans: The difference is while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage
                is
                cleared when
                the page
                session ends.</p>

            <h1>#2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h1>
            <p class="para-gap">Ans: Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code
                block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are
                examples of structure that create a code block. <br><br>
                A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. A
                variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible
                within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces
                are called as within block scope</p>

            <h1>#3. How does event loop work in javascript?</h1>
            <p class="para-gap">Ans: The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before
                pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call
                Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process. In this way event loop
                works in javascript.</p>
